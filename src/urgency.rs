/// Levels of Urgency.
///
/// # Specification
/// > Developers must use their own judgement when deciding the urgency of a notification. Typically, if the majority of programs are using the same level for a specific type of urgency, other applications should follow them.
/// >
/// > For low and normal urgencies, server implementations may display the notifications how they choose. They should, however, have a sane expiration timeout dependent on the urgency level.
/// >
/// > **Critical notifications should not automatically expire**, as they are things that the user will most likely want to know about. They should only be closed when the user dismisses them, for example, by clicking on the notification. 
///

/// # Example
/// ```no_run
/// # use notify_rust::*;
/// Notification::new()
///     .summary("oh no")
///     .icon("dialog-warning")
///     .urgency(Urgency::Critical)
///     .show()?;
